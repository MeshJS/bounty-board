# Mesh Bounty Board
Welcome at Mesh Bounty Board, a initiative to help grow the Cardano ecosystem while rewarding contributors for their efforts. 
Here, you can find a variety of open tasks (bounties), from software development to content creation, all focused on strengthening the Mesh platform and the Cardano ecosystem as a whole.

## What Are Mesh Bounties?
Mesh bounties are open tasks posted to the community. Anyone who sees a match between their skill set and a bounty’s requirements can claim ownership and complete the work. Our bounties cover a broad range of areas—primarily coding and development, but also educational materials, tutorials, videos, and articles. Although our core focus is on technical contributions, we welcome all forms of value addition.

## Rewards
All bounties are incentivized with multiple types of rewards:

- ADA: The primary currency of Cardano, offered as financial compensation.
- Mesh Minute Tokens: A Cardano-native token we mint to recognize the time and effort spent by contributors. These tokens serve as a social proof of contribution and will play a more prominent role as the bounty program matures.

## Why Does Mesh Host Bounties?
While the Mesh core team is dedicated to building on Cardano, we’re a relatively small group. We see great potential in collaborating with the larger Cardano community—individuals who are equally passionate and talented. By hosting bounties, we aim to:

- Distribute the workload among community contributors and the core team.
- Lower the barriers for newcomers and experienced developers to engage with Mesh and the Cardano ecosystem.
- Identify and foster long-term relationships with skilled contributors.
- Experiment with collective, community-driven innovation.


## How to Get Started
Requirements:
